Scraping movies and tv series from Vidsrc.to, Flixhq.to and Watchseriesx.to

At the moment the purpose of this repository is to expose methods used 
to scrape websites.

In the future it could be developed a user interface to allow regular users
to watch movies/tv series easily.

### How to run it

```sh
npm run start
```

Examples of how to request an episode/movie can be found in the `test` function
of each class (`Vidsrc`, `FlixHQ`, `Watchseries`).
